For my Movie Recommender System project, I utilized the NLTK library for stemming, allowing the system to process and understand user input more effectively. The recommender algorithm suggests movies based on user preferences and input keywords. I deployed the system locally using Streamlit, creating an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to explore movie recommendations.
